# **Land Rover Marketing Insights: Predicting Customer Preferences**

## **Overview**
This project uses data analysis and machine learning to uncover actionable insights for Land Rover's marketing strategy. By analyzing survey data from 400 participants, I explored the factors influencing SUV purchase intent and developed predictive models to help Land Rover target potential buyers effectively. This project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## **Features**

- **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:  
  - Processed raw survey data, addressed missing values, and prepared a structured dataset for analysis.  
  - Conducted exploratory analysis to uncover meaningful correlations, such as adventurousness and confidence influencing purchase likelihood.  

- **Dimensionality Reduction**:  
  - Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensionality, retaining 83% of data variability while simplifying feature sets.  

- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - Built and evaluated multiple models for predicting purchase intent:
    - **Linear Regression**: Provided insights into key traits influencing purchase behavior.  
    - **Random Forest Classification**: Achieved a 90% accuracy rate in identifying high-potential buyers, outperforming Naive Bayes.
